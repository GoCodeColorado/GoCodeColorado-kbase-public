CDLE Oil and Public Safety Data
Last Updated: ​ 3/1/

The Colorado Department of Labor & Employment ​ ​(CDLE) connects job seekers with
great jobs, provides an up-to-date and accurate picture of the economy to help decision making,
assists workers who have been injured on the job, ensures fair labor practices, helps those who
have lost their jobs by providing temporary wage replacement through unemployment benefits,
and protects the workplace - and Colorado communities - with a variety of consumer protection
and safety programs. Find us at ​ https://www.colorado.gov/cdle ​.

Within the Colorado Department of Labor & Employment, ​ the Division of Oil and Public
Safety ​ (OPS) successfully partners with regulated business owners and operators in Colorado
to protect the public and our environment by ensuring the safe storage and use of fuel products
and explosives and the safe operation of amusement rides, boilers and conveyances. Find us at
https://www.colorado.gov/ops ​.

The OPS Petroleum Program is responsible for protecting human health and the environment
from petroleum releases caused by regulated storage tank systems. This includes oversight of
assessment and cleanup of regulated substances from both underground storage tank (UST)
and above ground storage tank (AST) systems.

OPS and GoCode Colorado 2019
All of the ​Open Petroleum Release Events​ from regulated storage tank systems are reported to
OPS. These release events are currently being investigated, assessed/remediated or are
obtaining closure.

Geodata contained in this dataset can provide insight regarding where petroleum product
releases are located in relation to water sources. Since the contact information for OPS
technical reviewers is included in this dataset, inquiries may be made directly to them if there
are any questions about the release events.

Active and Closed Events
For active and closed events, navigate to the ​ Active and Closed Petroleum Release Events
in Colorado ​ dataset. This dataset is updated monthly from the ​ Colorado Storage Tank
Information System (COSTIS) database ​, and the locations are generated from point address
based geocoding.

Working with Petroleum Release Data
Each row in these datasets represents one release record, or rather, one site cleanup. Each
release record may be researched further on the public-facing COSTIS database.

Finding the Data
A user may access the OPS Petroleum Release Events dataset by navigating to
https://data.colorado.gov/Environment/OPS-Petroleum-Release-Events-in-Colorado/x235-
reiv ​, or by navigating to ​ https://data.colorado.gov ​, searching for OPS and selecting the “OPS
Petroleum Release Events in Colorado” dataset.

The dataset description is as follows:

Underground Storage Tank (UST) system and Aboveground Storage Tank
(AST) system petroleum release events, with their associated locations,
contacts for remediation, and status in relation to currently being
investigated, assessed, remediated, obtaining closure, or closed, dating
back to 1986. Data provided by the State of Colorado, Department of Labor
& Employment, Division of Oil & Public Safety. There is no guarantee the
data published is 100% accurate, correct, current or complete.
Insights to Using OPS Release Data
The Status field indicates whether a release event is open or closed.

● If the release is ​ closed ​, it has occurred through one of the four types of closures:
○ Tier I Closure: ​ Chemicals of Concern (COCs) are below the Maximum
Contaminant Levels (MCLs) in all medium (groundwater, soil and soil vapor) at
the time of closure.
○ Tier II Closure: ​ COCs are below the Site Specific Target Levels or MCLs in all
medium onsite at the time of closure with no offsite COC impacts
○ Tier III Closure: ​ A public roadway property boundary is the only impacted point
of exposure
○ Tier IV Closure: ​ Property boundaries are the only impacted point of exposure.
(Detailed information about the Tiered Closure Types is available in the OPS ​ Release
Closure Guidance ​.)
● If a release is ​ open ​, the type field refers to the site’s current step in the remediation
process. The following may be found in the type field:
○ Assessment ​ - The site’s remediation plan is being determined.
○ Brownfield ​ - The site has been designated as a Brownfield site and is eligible for
state funding for redevelopment.
○ Enforcement ​- Actions taken (or not taken) during remediation are out of
compliance with State regulations and have invoked an enforcement action from
the State.
○ Implementing CAP/ Implementing CAP OOC ​ - The site’s Corrective Action
Plan (CAP) is being implemented. (OOC = Out of Compliance)
○ LUST Trust ​ - The site’s cleanup is financed by the Environmental Protection
Agency.
○ SCR Complete ​ - The site’s initial contamination report is complete and CAP
preparation can begin.
○ State Lead ​ - The site has been accepted for State Lead cleanup. For more
information about the OPS State Lead Program, please visit

Other Dataset Information
● This dataset was initially posted on the Colorado Information Marketplace in June 2016
to provide improved data accessibility to the public and stakeholders.
● This dataset is updated monthly, usually on the first day of the month. Additional fields
have been added to the dataset since its original creation based on user feedback,
including county and closure field data.

More detailed release information is available in the ​ COSTIS database ​, which is managed by
OPS technical reviewers and administrative staff.

Reports and site maps are also available to the public via a ​ request to the OPS Public
Records Center ​.
