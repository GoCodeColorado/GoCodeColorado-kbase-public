# Distributed Tools

### Collaborative Engagement in Google Docs

Google Docs and their online suite are great for team collaboration and provide versioning and capture historical changes online. Create a single document or spreadsheet send it to your teammates and collaborate from anywhere.

### Efficient Communication -- When to use slack and when to use email

Email alerts attention to an action, it is not a place for discussion. Email you have to cc select people who are compelled to reply. Slack is for discussion items related to a project. All internal communication is sent and stored in a recent message system (most highly amplified with links to google docs, git repos, forum links, and a variety of other project relevant links). Slack allows people to read and research, and discuss as a group.

Email is most beneficial when the group needs to communicate externally for engagement or action.

### How to Use Slack

__Threads__ - allow conversations to be captured along similar topics while still engaging the group.

__Searching messages__ - in email it is almost impossible to remember the exact descriptive words people used in the subject, but in slack you can search all the messages for a single work or keyword that makes it much easier to find the resource or message you were searching for.

__Pinned docs__ - you have the ability to “pin” items to a channel of your slack organization which allows anyone to easily find important documents in seconds.

The #1 reason people don’t use slack “Its not the first place I check” Send me “urgent messages in email”

Urgency should not distinguish which tech you check, the sender should accompany their message with a mark of urgency.
