Produced by Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, this document provides a quick glance resource for understanding how health care facilities are managed at the state of Colorado. These datasets can be found using keyword ‘gocodecolorado’ as they meet standards for Go Code Colorado publishing and metadata. All these datasets are related based on their theme, and this doc provides context for that relationship.

**Disclaimer**: There are no restrictions and legal prerequisites for using these datasets. The state of Colorado and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment assumes no liability to the completeness, correctness, or fitness for use of these datasets. Please contact the GIS Coordinator at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment for more information on how geospatial data was assembled, using the data set, or to request additional access to the data. Users of the data should consider factors such as the data source, time period, assignment of geography, statistical reliability, and calculation of rate.
