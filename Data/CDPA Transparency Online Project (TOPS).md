# State Government Expenditures and Revenues

**Table of Contents:**


[TOC]



# Overview


#### **History**

On April 2, 2009, Governor Bill Ritter issued Executive Order D 007 09 Establishing the Transparency Online Project (TOP). The Executive Order was supported by elected officials Treasurer Cary Kennedy, Secretary of State Bernie Buescher, and Attorney General John Suthers, as well as representatives from the Judicial and Executive Branches of Government. In the 2009 legislative session, the Legislature enacted and the Governor signed House Bill 09-1288, which aligns with the Executive Order. The Order stated the following:

"Transparency and accountability to state citizens is a hallmark of good government. The Open Meetings Act and the Colorado Open Records Act provide Colorado's citizens with a strong expectation of accountability by providing open access to the state's public records and meetings. The advent of the internet provides new opportunities for state governments to foster transparency and accountability."

The subject of a Colorado searchable database of state financial information was first broached by Representative Don Marostica in the 2007 legislative session with House Bill 07-1164. While that bill was not enacted, Representative Marostica worked with other state elected officials to support the Governor's 2009 Executive Order establishing the TOP system.

On July 1, 2014, the State implemented a new ERP system, CORE.  A new transparency web site was launched on January 1, 2015 containing information from the new system.  The old transparency site will be available for access to data prior to July 1, 2014.

The TOP system is not intended to replace Colorado citizen's access to public information allowed by the Colorado Open Records Act. Rather it is intended to reduce the time and cost associated with open records requests and to maximize convenience for state citizens in accessing state financial information. Any information that is not available in the TOP system remains available to the public in accordance with the Colorado Open Records Act.


#### **CIM - Colorado Information Marketplace**

In July of 2020 The State updated TOPS by migrating to a Socrata (Tyler Technologies) database located on the Colorado Information Marketplace.  This database is titled “State Government Revenues and Expenditures in Colorado.”  The advantages of this platform include: 

1. Expanded field selection: now includes Appropriation, CFDA/PPC suffix, Major Program & Program, financial statement and statement line fields

2. Improved user query capabilities: users can query on any field in the database 

3. Improved download capability: unlimited download capabilities

4. Standardization of delivery: CIM is The State’s repository for distributing data to the public and the Socrata database is the standard delivery platform.


#### **Contents and updates**

The State Government Revenues and Expenditures in Colorado database contains revenue and expenditure transactions beginning with fiscal year 2015 and is updated weekly.  It reconciles to the following CAFR financial statements before any manual financial statement adjustments:

Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position Fiduciary Funds

Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances Governmental Funds

Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances Reconciled to Statement of Activities

Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Fund Net Position Proprietary Funds

Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Fund Net Position Proprietary Funds - Internal Services Fund


#### **Data prior to fiscal year 2015**

This site contains data for Fiscal Year 2015 to present.  For data from Fiscal Year 2009 - 2014, Please go to the archive transparency site:  [http://topsarchive.state.co.us](http://topsarchive.state.co.us/tops_Bud2ActFY.htm)


# Disclaimers


#### **Inclusions and exclusions**

Click here for more information on [Submitting a Data Exclusion Challenge](http://topsarchive.state.co.us/tops_challenge.htm). You may find it helpful to read the following description of data included and excluded from TOPS.

Colorado Revised Statutes (CRS) 24-72.4-103 specifies the data that must be included, must be excluded, or may be excluded from the Transparency Online Project System (TOPS).  It requires TOPS:



*   to include State expenditures and revenues based on the State's official book of record (COFRS prior to July 1, 2014, CORE going forward),
*   to be accessible through a link from every State agency homepage,
*   to be updated every five days (TOPS data is currently updated for each day's CORE transactions),
*   reports to be available for download in a self-described machine readable format (such as XML),
*   to include a method for users to provide feedback about the system,
*   to include 10 years of historical data beginning with Fiscal Year 2009-10 (TOPS currently contains historical data beginning with Fiscal Year 2008-09).

The statute specifically directs the following data be excluded:



*   Information that is not a public record,
*   Information that is exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Colorado Open Records Act,
*   Information that is confidential under state or federal law, and
*   Information contained in unstructured data fields (such as description fields where the State is unable to ensure the large number of accounting system technicians entering transactions do not enter protected information),

In compliance with these requirements, personal identifying information such as Social Security Number, Employer Identification Number, address, telephone number, and email address are excluded from TOPS reports.

CRS 24-72.4-103 allows a State agency's upper management to exclude certain data when they determine that the potential injury to the public interest (which includes the privacy, safety, and security of individuals) outweighs the public interest in having the data easily accessible on TOPS.

CRS 24-72.4-103(2) provides a way for citizens to challenge the exclusion of data from TOPS. To get additional information on submitting a challenge click on this link: [Submitting a Data Exclusion Challenge](http://topsarchive.state.co.us/tops_challenge.htm).

The statute's requirements are consistent with the Executive Order that originally created TOPS.  The Governor's Executive Order required that TOPS "shall be developed in a manner that protects and respects citizen and vendor privacy, safety, and security".  This last requirement is an ethical consideration agreed to by the elected officials supporting the Executive Order.  In order to protect and respect citizen and vendor privacy, safety, and security, the State Controller in cooperation with the Attorney General's Office and the controllers of individual departments and agencies of the state developed a process to identify instances where the presentation of a vendor name would compromise the privacy, safety or security of a citizen.  In that process, the following record types were identified, and the related actual vendor names are excluded from presentation on TOPS by changing those vendor names to "CO - Confidential".

As required by CRS 24-72.4-103(1)(h), the following list provides a description of the data excluded from TOPS, the basis for excluding the data, and the agency requesting the data be excluded (contact information is provided).  This information was provided by individual State agencies and has not been changed or edited in any way.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Department of Human Services (I***)</span>**

The Colorado Department of Human Services (CDHS) has had the detail (Vendor Name) excluded for two object codes due to Protected Health Information (PHI) concerns under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  Summary dollar amounts are still available to provide the public with the amounts spent for these two functions. The two object (expenditure) codes are patient and client care expenses called Care and Subsistence - Client Benefits and Care and Subsistence - Rent to Clients.  Both of these expenditure codes represent payments made directly to clients/patients.  The vendor (client/patient) name combined with the title of the object code identifies the vendor as a client/patient which is PHI and cannot be disclosed to the public without a release from the client/patient under the health information privacy law.  There are large fines for making protected health information available to the public.  By noting the vendor name as "confidential" for these two expenditure codes, all client/patient protected health information remains secure and the public still has access to the amounts paid using these expenditure codes.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Judicial Department (JAAA)</span>**

The Colorado Judicial Department requests that the juror names associated with payments to jurors be excluded from TOPS.  The reasons for this are:



1. Juror names could be either jurors for petit jury duty or for grand jury duty.
2. Section 13-71-136, C.R.S. controls the availability of juror information for petit juries.  Upon a court order, juror names are not available for public inspection.
3. Section 13-72-103, C.R.S., states the court may enter an order to preserve the confidentiality of all information that might identify grand jurors.
4. The CORE system would not be able to identify those jurors for whom the court had entered an order suppressing the names of the jurors from public disclosure.

Because the court may order juror information suppressed in any trial or grand jury proceeding, juror names cannot be displayed in the TOPS program.

**Fund 2690:** Witness Protection Fund [CRS 24-33.5-106]

**Description of Exclusion**:  Vendor information has been excluded from Transparency Online Project System.

**Basis for Exclusion: ** This fund accounts for payments to individuals in the Witness Protection Program and disclosure of a witness's name could impact their personal safety, as well as the safety of family members.  Monies expended are made in connection with protecting the safety of a witness "...during or subsequent to an official proceeding or investigation that involves great public interest..."  Since the Colorado Criminal Justice Records Act covers records of all law enforcement agencies, not just those within the CDPS, witness protection fund records are properly outside the objectives of Transparency Online Project System and should be excluded.  The Department is statutorily required to submit an annual report to the General Assembly, and upon submission, the report becomes a public record on deposit with the Colorado State Publications Library.

**Fund 2060: ** State Patrol Contraband Fund [CRS 24-33.5-225]

**Description of Exclusion: ** Vendor information has been excluded from Transparency Online Project System. 

**Basis for Exclusion: ** Statute requires the Department to submit a report annually on contraband funds and limits the reporting to object codes.  The published report does not reflect vendor names, amounts, or dates of transactions.  This financial data should be excluded from the Transparency Online Project System, as the annual report required by statute is already a public record on deposit with the Colorado State Publications Library.

**Fund 12D0: ** Colorado Bureau of Investigation Contraband Fund [CRS 24-33.5-415.2]

**Description of Exclusion: ** Vendor information has been excluded from Transparency Online Project System.

**Basis for Exclusion: ** Statute requires the Department to submit a report annually on contraband funds and limits the reporting to object codes.  The published report does not reflect vendor names, amounts, or dates of transactions.  This financial data should be excluded from the Transparency Online Project System, as the annual report required by statute is already a public record on deposit with the Colorado State Publications Library.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Department of Regulatory Agencies (SJAA & SIAA )</span>**

The Department of Regulatory Agencies, Division of Professions and Occupations, provides aggregate data regarding its expert witness expenditures for each of its 31 listed programs.  Names of the experts retained in individual cases are excluded from the Transparency Online Project System ("TOPS") for the reasons set forth below.  Instead, the aggregate data for each program is identified through TOPS under purchased services, personal services, professional, and co-confidential.

The Division of Professions and Occupations relies on Section 24-72.4-103(1)(g)(I), (II), and (IV), C.R.S., for this exclusion.

Section 24-72.4-103(1)(g)(I) requires exclusion from TOPS of information that is not a public record or that is exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Colorado Open Records Act.  Many of the organic acts governing programs within the Division of Professions and Occupations provide that investigations of individual disciplinary cases are not a matter of public record.  See, e.g., Section 12-32-108.3(12) (Podiatry Board), 12-35-129(7)(e) (Board of Dental Examiners), 12-36-118(10) (Board of Medicine), 12-38-116.5(9) (Board of Nursing), 12-38.1-114(13) (Nurse Aide Advisory Committee), and 12-43-224(4) (Mental Health programs), C.R.S.  Where needed, retention of an expert is part of the investigatory process for the programs within the Division of Professions and Occupations.

Section 24-72.4-103(1)(g)(II) requires exclusion from TOPS of information that is confidential pursuant to state or federal law.  State and federal law provide that where an expert has been retained or specially employed in anticipation of litigation or preparation for trial and is not expected to be called as a witness at a trial, discovery regarding that expert is permitted only under exceptional circumstances.  See CRCP 26(b)(4); Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4).

Section 24-72.4-103(1)(g)(IV) requires exclusion from TOPS of information that the director of the agency has requested to not be disclosed because the potential injury to the public interest arising from the disclosure of such information through TOPS outweighs the public interest in having such information publicly available through TOPS.  The director of the Division of Professions and Occupations has made such a request because the disclosure of the information through TOPS would negatively impact the ability of the programs within her Division to regulate professionals effectively.  For a variety of reasons, many experts who agree to review cases for the professional boards within the Division of Professions and Occupations wish to keep their identities confidential unless and until disclosure is required by the Rules of Civil Procedure.  By respecting confidentiality, the Division of Professions and Occupations is able to retain in-state, high quality expert consultants to opine on the standard of practice for compensation at current rates.  With the assistance of such professionals, the programs are able, within their limited budgets, to determine where disciplinary action is warranted.  These programs protect the public by identifying and disciplining problematic practitioners, and then making that disciplinary information available to consumers and the public.

The data regarding the cost of experts retained by the Division of Professions and Occupations is not excluded.  Instead, each program provides aggregate data as described above.  Section 24-72.4-103(1)(i)(I) permits the Division through TOPS to provide aggregated information where access to each individual transaction is likely to hinder, rather than foster, the goal of accountability and transparency.  As described above, the goal of accountability and transparency would be hindered rather than fostered if the identities of individual experts were disclosed through TOPS.

# Tips


#### #1 Use the “Contains” operator when filtering

The “Vendor Legal Name - Not Redacted” field includes the vendor name and the assigned CORE vendor ID.  Use the “Contains” operator together with a portion of the vendor name that you know.  Use the query results to narrow your search down to a specific vendor name or ID and refilter.  Use the same technique Account Name and other fields.
