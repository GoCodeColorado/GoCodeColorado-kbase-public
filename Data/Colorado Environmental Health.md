# Data for Environmental Health

Data about Environmental Health is actually somewhat of an anomaly. There are few accurate and reliable sources of data, because, quite simply, the rule that correlation is not causation dictates many limitations for the use. What isn&#39;t ruled out of usefulness from that scenario is removed because of personally identifiable information. That being said, this assemblage of a variety of health-related datasets is an expansive view of what may be health-related as many of these datasets fall in the environmental health area.

The mission at Go Code Colorado is to make public data more accessible and useful for informed business decision making. We do that primarily through publishing state-level data to the state&#39;s open data platform, the Colorado Information Marketplace. But we know data in combination is key so we look at all kinds of data sources when considering analysis. The datasets highlighted in **RED** are our featured datasets--that we have assisted in publishing. The blue highlight is for community resources we are aware of.

## Denver Resources

## Colorado Resources with Environmental Health Relevance

- **Colorado Department of State** : Durable Medical Equipment Suppliers in Colorado. Durable medical equipment (DME) and disposable medical supplies are medically necessary. In general, this means that the DME/supply has a medical purpose that is appropriate for the intended use, and it is the most cost effective item available. Some examples of equipment that are considered DME include: oxygen, wheelchairs, walkers and bathroom/bedroom safety equipment. This dataset [**Durable Medical Equipment Suppliers in Colorado**](https://data.colorado.gov/Health/Durable-Medical-Equipment-Suppliers-in-Colorado/s7ct-nf65) provides the location of DME in Colorado.
- **Colorado Department Of Public Safety** : Crime Statistics By Police District. Crime data is collected by local Police Districts (sheriff, police and state agencies) and then reported up to the State Department of Criminal Justice to provide these aggregate statistics for the state. Arrests are incidents in which an individual was actually booked and charged. The annual report represents data on crimes ([**Offenses**](https://data.colorado.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Offenses-Reported-by-Police-District-in-Colo/ya69-n6ta) and [**Arrests**](https://data.colorado.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Arrests-Reported-by-Police-District-in-Color/2e5i-5hfy)) reported by law enforcement agencies through the Colorado Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR) and are stored in the Colorado Crime Information Center(CCIC) computer located at the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. During 2015, 245 law enforcement agencies were responsible for reporting crimes and arrests to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI).
- **Boulder County** : Septic Systems In Boulder County Colorado. Septic system data including type, status and location for dwellings within Boulder County, Colorado provided by Boulder County can be found in the[Septic Systems in Boulder County Colorado](https://data.colorado.gov/Municipal/Septic-Systems-in-Boulder-County-Colorado/ihbp-hi2s)[Colorado]. Additionally, there is information on the duration of permitting process, the engineer and installer, the lot size and number of bedrooms (for residential sites), and also the depth to bedrock and site soil type. Septic systems are the second most frequently cited source of groundwater contamination in the US. Unapproved, aging, and failing septic systems have a large impact on the quality and safety of the water.
- **Colorado Department Of Public Health And Environment** : Healthcare Facilities. There are five themed data sets pertaining to the location and function of healthcare facilities for the State of Colorado. The primary data set, [**Health Facilities**](https://data.colorado.gov/Health/CDPHE-Health-Facilities/98pp-s4r4)**,** includes known regulated health facilities in Colorado, and is developed directly from address information obtained directly from the Health Facilities and Emergency Medical Services Division. Also in this suite are [**Community Behavioral Health Centers**](https://data.colorado.gov/Health/CDPHE-Community-Behavioral-Health-Centers/7jcr-yuy9), [**Drug Treatment Programs and Resources**](https://data.colorado.gov/Health/CDPHE-Colorado-Drug-Treatment-Programs-and-Resourc/ic4p-uss4) and a wide variety of other socio-demographic data sets relevant to healthcare. For more on Behavioral Statistics and Emergency Management related data, such as Durable Medical Equipment, see the [**Health and Environment Available Dataset Summary for Go Code Colorado**](https://github.com/GoCodeColorado/GoCodeColorado-kbase-public/blob/master/HealthandEnvironmentAvailableDatasetSummaryforGoCodeColorado.pdf) on GitHub. For more information about GitHub, see the [**Resources**](http://gocode.colorado.gov/compete/team-resources/) page in the [**Compete**](http://gocode.colorado.gov/compete/) section of this website.
- **Colorado Department Of Local Affairs Housing Division** : Foreclosures. The Department of Local Affairs Housing Division tracks both the number of home [**Foreclosure Filings in Colorado**](https://data.colorado.gov/Housing/Foreclosure-Filings-in-Colorado/chpv-m4xq) and [**Foreclosure Sales in Colorado**](https://data.colorado.gov/Housing/Foreclosure-Sales-in-Colorado/tn2f-pf3u) by county for each quarter. As a complement to the existing Rents and Vacancies data, the Housing Division has released Foreclosures in Colorado, a new dataset this year with 2015-2016 data. Foreclosure filings provide a good guide to foreclosure activity in a given county, and whereas a property may be withdrawn from the foreclosure process after a filing is made, the filings statistics nevertheless indicate where borrowers are delinquent and in default.
- **Colorado Department Of Local Affairs Demography Division** : Census. This year the DOLA Census division has published 10 geospatial data sets, five for [**2009-2013**](https://data.colorado.gov/browse?limitTo=maps&amp;amp;q=2009&amp;amp;sortBy=relevance&amp;amp;tags=census&amp;amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93) and five for [**2011-2015**](https://data.colorado.gov/browse?limitTo=maps&amp;amp;q=2015&amp;amp;sortBy=relevance&amp;amp;tags=census&amp;amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93). For those who have tried and struggled, you know why it is so valuable that Go Code Colorado and the Demography Division work together to make census data updates easily available each year. Quite simply, it can be very difficult to get data from the American Community Service website that is specific to the region you are looking for and the fields you need.
- **Colorado Department Of Human Services** : Licensed Child Care Facilities. The Colorado Department of Human Services (CDHS) updates the [Licensed Child Care Facilities](https://data.colorado.gov/Human-Services/Colorado-Licensed-Child-Care-Facilities-Monthly-Re/a9rr-k8mu) dataset monthly with any changes or additions to non-24 hour licensed child care facilities in the State of Colorado. Fields include CDHS-issued child care license numbers and legal business names of the child care facility programs as they appear in the licensing application as well as the physical location addresses (including coordinates). For each location, the total licensed capacity and the types of services and programs are provided. Also included in this data set is the Colorado Shines quality rating level (if applicable), and whether the location utilizes the Colorado Child Care Assistance Program(CCCAP).
- **Colorado Department Of Labor And Employment** : Open/Closed Petroleum Release Events In Colorado. All the [**Open Petroleum Release Events**](https://data.colorado.gov/Environment/Active-OPS-Petroleum-Release-Events-in-Colorado/v5ut-qgp7) that are currently active petroleum releases from regulated storage tank systems are reported to the State of Colorado&#39;s Division of Oil &amp; Public Safety. These petroleum releases (or &quot;events&quot;) are currently being investigated, assessed or remediated, or are obtaining closure. For active and closed events, navigate to the [**Active and Closed Petroleum Release Events in Colorado**](https://data.colorado.gov/Environment/Active-Closed-OPS-Petroleum-Release-Events-in-Colo/g3jr-97se) dataset. The Petroleum Program within the division is responsible for protecting human health and the environment from petroleum releases caused by regulated storage tank systems. This includes oversight of assessment and cleanup of regulated substances from both underground storage tank (UST) and above ground storage tank (AST) systems. This dataset is updated monthly from the Colorado Storage Tank Information System (COSTIS) Database, and the locations are generated from point address.

## General Resources with Relevance to Environmental Health

- [Google Public Data Directory](https://www.google.com/publicdata/directory) - Google Public Data viewer is a great resource to view various large pen datasets to better understand things like Labor Statistics and Broadband performance. In this scenario there are a handful of visualizations
- [Google Tables](https://research.google.com/tables) - helps you search thousands of public Fusion Tables, or millions of public tables from around the web you can import to FusionTables (make sure you click Fusion Table instead of Web Table in the options bar on the left if you want to get raw data). For example - here is a geocoded table of all the [Colorado Breweries](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1qJMHcOYsqgOCu64Vi_HWNU-yne-nfBNF4tL6UQ3m)- public and free touse!
- [**OpenStreetMap**](https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/15/getting-point-of-interest-data-from-openstreetmap) has millions of points of interest which will serve you well for this. These are &quot;nodes&quot; (points) each tagged with a set of keywords that indicate what each point is. For example, you might have a node with latitude 51.398, longitude -1.082, and tags amenity=place\_of\_worship, name=St Mary&#39;s Church. This indicates that there&#39;s a church called St Mary&#39;s Church at that lat and lon

So you need to get this data out of OSM. The first step is to identify which tags interest you. You might want, for example, everything tagged as a church. In other words, everything with amenity=place\_of\_worship. (The first part of the tag is the &#39;key&#39;, the second the &#39;value&#39;. You can see a long list of common OSM tags [on their wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features). There are two ways you can get this data out of the OSM database. One is by using XAPI, the Extended API. XAPI allows you to query the server for data matching certain tags. It can be very slow, so certainly isn&#39;t suitable for live use (you shouldn&#39;t use OSM servers for your live app anyway).

But it&#39;s an easy way to download a lot of data matching certain criteria. The ideal way, however, is to download the OpenStreetMap data dump and filter it according to your needs. The data dump is called planet.osm. You can either download the whole world (really huge), or just an extract covering one country or state. Once you&#39;ve downloaded it, a wonderful Java program called Osmosis will do all the hard work of extracting the data for you, and either loading the result into a database, or outputting it as a file.

- [Yelp LIVES](https://www.yelp.com/healthscores) - Local Inspector Value-Entry Specification, Restaurant Inspection Data integrated with Yelp in [~20 cities/locations](https://www.yelp.com/healthscores/feeds)
