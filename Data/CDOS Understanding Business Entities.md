# Understanding Business Entities in Colorado

[Business Entities in Colorado](https://data.colorado.gov/Business/Business-Entities-in-Colorado/4ykn-tg5h) is a roster of corporations, LLCs, etc. registered with the Colorado Secretary of State (aka Department of State or CDOS). The business registration goes back to the 1800&#39;s, with over 1 million records available. It contains business name, principal address, mailing address, owner name, owner address, entity status, type and creation date. As of March 2019 there are over 1.84 million unique business ids registered with the State of Colorado, counting back to the 1800s, and there is a (very rough) average of 2,000 new businesses added each week.

There are five basic factors in this dataset, in addition to the address columns. Entity and Entity Id are the business number from CDOS (also the unique identifier) and registered business name. Principal Address, however, is not always guaranteed to be the physical location of the business entity&#39;s main operation. Some businesses can be registered in CO but have an address outside of the state or may list a PO box and there are businesses with locations that don&#39;t have a public access entry point. Mailing Address is the mailing address of the business owner, and the Agent address may be the address of the agent or in some cases has the same address as the business owner. The year in Entity Form Date is corroborated by the first four digits of the Entity Id.

The Secretary of State has never been required to collect the name of the business owner. If a business has an alias (ie Doing Business As) then this information can be found in the separate dataset, [Trade Names for Businesses in Colorado](https://data.colorado.gov/Business/Trade-Names-for-Businesses-in-Colorado/u7sb-g482). The Entity Status has information on whether the business is kept up to date with their annual filing, and the Entity Type is the designation of the business entity (Corporation, LLC, etc.).

There are 24 address columns representing 4 different addresses: the principal and mailing addresses for both the entity and the agent. The entity is intended to represent the physical location of the business, but there are cases where the entity does not receive mail at their physical location and a post office box is used instead. The agent is best understood as the Registered Agent. A registered agent for a business needs to have a Colorado address and serves as the contact for the entity. In the event of litigation, the service of process goes to the registered agent. The Secretary of State collected data requesting a name for an &quot;officer&quot; or singular point of contact for the business, but this was discontinued in early 2000s because business structure became too complex and managing that data became too labor intensive.

Business location can be geocoded using the Principal Address information, however location is not guaranteed to be physical location of business in every case. Principal Address is used to generate the geocoded column &quot;Location,&quot; however, as mentioned above, it is not always guaranteed to be the physical location of the business entity&#39;s main operation. Some may choose to have mail sent to a separate location, some businesses can be registered in CO but have an address outside of the state, some other businesses (wholesale for example) don&#39;t have a public access entry point, and finally, there are also businesses that have operations spread across several addresses.

Mailing Address is the mailing address of the business owner, and the Agent address may be the address of the agent or in some cases these addresses are the same. The year in Entity Form Date is corroborated by the first four digits of the Entity Id.
