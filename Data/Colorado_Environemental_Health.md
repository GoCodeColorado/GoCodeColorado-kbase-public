# Data for Environmental Health

**Last Updated:** 3/22/2019

Data about Environmental Health is actually somewhat of an anomaly. There are few accurate and reliable sources of data, because, quite simply, the rule that correlation is not causation dictates many limitations for the use. What isn&#39;t ruled out of usefulness from that scenario is removed from use because of personally identifiable information.That being said, this assemblage of a variety of health-related datasets is an expansive view of what may be health-related as many of these datasets fall in the environmental health area. The mission at Go Code Colorado is to make public data more accessible and useful for informed business decision making. We do that primarily through publishing state-level data to the state&#39;s open

data platform, the Colorado Information Marketplace. But we know data in combination is key so we look at all kinds of data sources when considering analysis. The datasets highlighted in **RED** are our featured datasets--that we have assisted in publishing. The bluehighlight is for community resources we are aware of.

## General Resources with Relevance to Environmental Health

- [Google Public Data Directory](https://www.google.com/publicdata/directory)- Google Public Data viewer is a great resource to view variouslargependatasetstobetterunderstandthingslikeLaborStatistics,Broadband performance, in this scenario there are a handful of visualizations that are powered by downloadable
- [Google Tables](https://research.google.com/tables)- helps you search thousands of public Fusion Tables, or millions of publictablesfromaroundthewebyoucanimporttoFusionTables(makesureyouclick Fusion Table instead of Web Table in the options bar on the left if you want to get raw data). For example - here is a geocoded table of all the[Colorado Breweries](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1qJMHcOYsqgOCu64Vi_HWNU-yne-nfBNF4tL6UQ3m)- public and free touse!
- [**OpenStreetMap**](https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/15/getting-point-of-interest-data-from-openstreetmap)has millions of points of interest which will serve you well for this. These are &quot;nodes&quot; (points) each tagged with a set of keywords that indicate what each point is. For example, you might have a node with latitude 51.398, longitude -1.082, and tags amenity=place\_of\_worship, name=St Mary&#39;s Church. This indicates that there&#39;s a church called St Mary&#39;s Church at that lat and
  - So you need to get this data out of OSM. The first step is to identify which tags you&#39;reinterestedYoumightwant,forexample,everythingtaggedasachurch:

in other words, everything with amenity=place\_of\_worship. (The first part of the tag is the &#39;key&#39;, the second the &#39;value&#39;. You can see a long list of common OSM tags [on our wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features).). There are two ways you can get this data out of the OSM database. One is by using XAPI, the Extended API. XAPI allows you to query the server for data matching certain tags. It can be very slow, so certainly isn&#39;t suitable for live use (you shouldn&#39;t use OSM servers for your live app anyway).

But it&#39;s an easy way to download a lot of data matching certain criteria. The ideal way, however, is to download the OpenStreetMap data dump and filter it according to your needs. The data dump is called planet.osm. You can either download the whole world (really huge), or just an extract covering one country or state.Once you&#39;ve downloaded it, a wonderful Java program called Osmosis will do all the hard work of extracting the data for you, and either loading the result into a database, or outputting it as a file.
