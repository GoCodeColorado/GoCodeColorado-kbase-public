## Understanding LiquorLicenses

NOTE: There is overlap between theses these datasets. Liquor Licenses in Colorado, Recently Expired and Surrendered Liquor Licenses in Colorado, and Recently Approved Liquor Licenses in Colorado. As newly registered licenses are issued, their record is included in this roster and also in the Recently Approved Liquor Licenses in Colorado as this is a frequently requested subset.Whenlicensesexpire,theirrecordistransferredtotheRecentlySurrenderedorExpired Liquor Licenses in Colorado dataset where they are listed for two months before being dropped from all public active liquor licenselists.

## Using Liquor Licenses to Map Locations

Not all businesses list their point of sale locations with their liquor license registration and the listed address is not always guaranteed to be the physical location of the business&#39; main operation for the liquor license datasets, but event locations are expected to be the actual locations of the events.

## Liquor Licenses With Locations Outside of Colorado

NOTE: **Liquor Licenses in Colorado** , **Recently Expired and Surrendered Liquor Licenses in Colorado** , and **Recently Approved Liquor Licenses in Colorado** may contain address information from either a distributor, a manufacturer, or the headquarters of a business outside of Colorado.

**Example 1.** PF Chang&#39;s China Bistro Inc has an address listed in Scottsdale, AZ. The license type for this licensee is a &quot;Master File (Business).&quot; This means that PF Chang&#39;s China Bistro Inc has one master liquor license for all restaurant locations in Colorado. As such, there is no way to determine locations in Colorado holding an active liquor license.

**Example 2.** Alaskan Brewing LLC. This licensee is headquartered in Juneau, AK, but does not maintain any manufacturing or sales room locations in Colorado. The license type held by the licensee is a &quot;Nonresident Manufacturer (malt liquor).&quot;

## Businesses With Locations Inside of Colorado

**Example 1:** Red Lobster maintains a liquor license for each of its locations in Colorado and is listed by restaurant number in addition to a &quot;Master File (Business)&quot; license held by the headquarters in Orlando, FL. Each restaurant listed by number maintains a &quot;Hotel &amp; Restaurant (city)&quot; or &quot;Hotel &amp; Restaurant (county)&quot; license. In this example, the individual restaurants can be geolocated based on address, but the record containing the Master File cannot.

**Example 2:** Alaskan Brewing LLC. This licensee is headquartered in Juneau, AK, but does not maintain any manufacturing or sales room locations in Colorado. The license type held by the licensee is a &quot;Nonresident Manufacturer (malt liquor).&quot;

This likely means that Alaskan Brewing LLC is required to obtain a license to either:

1. (a)ToimportandsellmaltliquorswithinthestatefColoradotopersonslicensedas wholesalers pursuant to thisarticle;
2. (b)Tomaintainstocksfmaltliquorsandtoperatemaltliquorwarehousesbyprocuringamalt liquor wholesaler&#39;s license for each such operation as provided in thisarticle;
3. (c)To solicit orders from retail licensees and fill such orders through malt liquor
