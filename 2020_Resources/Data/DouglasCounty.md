## How to Get Started
DougCo data can be found in the following locations:

## Douglas County Roof Permits

This dataset contains building, roofing, electrical, mechanical, demolition, and driveway issued [permits for Douglas County](https://data.douglas.co.us/Economic/Roof-permit/3f4j-vyeh). City-issued permits are not in this dataset. The dataset tracks permits issued dating back to January of 1991, which makes this dataset somewhat older than many other available datasets. Users may find this data useful for the Smart Cities challenge category, as this dataset provides historical context to buildings in a largely suburban county.
